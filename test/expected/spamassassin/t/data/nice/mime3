;
;
; This message contains a ATOMICMAIL program.  If you are reading
; this now, that probably means that your mail reader does not know
; how to handle ATOMICMAIL programs.
; 
; If you were reading this with a mailer that had been extended to understand
; the ATOMICMAIL language, this mail message would automatically interact
; with you and take certain actions based on your responses.  However,
; the language is designed in such a way that ATOMICMAIL programs can
; NEVER do you serious harm.
; 
; If your computer has a ATOMICMAIL interpreter but it has not been linked
; into your mail system, you can run this program by piping the mail
; through the ATOMICMAIL interpreter.  (In Berkeley mail, for example, you simply type
; "pipe <message number> atomicmail".)  Otherwise, you can simply write the mail
; out to a file and then type "atomicmail that-file-name".
; 
; If your computer doesn't have any ATOMICMAIL software at all, you
; should probably reply to the sender of this message to tell
; him or her that you were unable to run this program.
