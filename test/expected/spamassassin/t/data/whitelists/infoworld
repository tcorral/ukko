LOOKING TO INNOVATE

Posted August 9, 2002 01:01 PM  Pacific Time


AMBER FOUND A brochure I had for Kauai, Hawaii. "What
is this, Cringe? Are you planning to surprise me with
a trip there?" I just hope she doesn't discover that
single plane ticket I bought.

Gates reveals the awful truth

At an impromptu meeting over lunch at Microsoft's
Financial Analysts Day in July, Bill Gates said
companies are not "super" innovative and don't produce
reliable products. No earth-shattering revelations
there, but in illustrating his point he asked, "Do you
really need the next version of Office? I don't think
so." Gates' implied he acknowledged users need a
compelling reason to upgrade to the next Office, my
spy said. The only thing that sells software these
days is the innovation factor, Gates claimed. "The
Tablet is going to be the most viral thing ever,"
Gates added. Of course, Microsoft has been touting the
Tablet PC for quite some time.

JavaScript pressure

Microsoft is looking to innovate, however, at least
when it comes to the European Computer Manufacturers
Association (ECMA). In terms of extending existing
scripting languages to support XML there appears to be
both good and bad news from ECMA, my spy said. The
good news is BEA recently showed ECMA how to better
extend scripting languages to work directly with XML.
The bad news is most people wouldn't recognize the
group today, which seems hell-bent on replacing
JavaScript (now called ECMAscript) with a derivative
that looks a lot like a C# scripting language.

A lack of chivalry

Big Blue is cracking the whip against employee
tailgaters, but not the variety typically associated
with college football games. Workers are being
reminded about a no tailgating policy, which means
they are forbidden from sliding their ID badge through
the security system, then holding the door for someone
who doesn't slide their badge. "We have been
instructed chivalry is dead concerning this matter,"
my spy said.

Speaking of chivalry's demise, common courtesy may be
going with it at the newly merged HP. Despite current
geopolitical situations, HP is relying on parts of its
support located in India. In so doing, HP bailed out
on a relationship with The Answer Group (TAG), with
which Compaq had a long-standing relationship. Adding
salt to the wound, though, HP's support folks in India
were telling customers and resellers about the TAG
termination before HP even told TAG.

"I BOOKED OUR tickets for Kauai," Amber said. I guess
I'm trapped now. No more tranquil escape for me.

QUOTE OF THE DAY:
"Of course, there is a lot of legislation that is
very favorable to folks that subsist on the exclusive
ownership of their code. We have lobbied against
those bills. It's easy to get negative about other
people's ideas. This is an opportunity to say,
'Here's a better idea: consider open source as an
alternative.' "

--Jeremy Hogan, community relations manager at Red Hat
Inc., speaking about a planned march on San Francisco
city hall to promote the use of open source software
in government offices.
