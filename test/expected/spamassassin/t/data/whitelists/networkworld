Today's focus: Combining point products and suites

By Audrey Rasmussen

Today we'll hear from readers who think the best route to take 
in the debate between point products and suites is to use a 
little of both.

One reader commented that a company doesn't have to choose one 
over the other. He says:

"It has been my experience that a well-managed enterprise 
monitoring system will most likely include some of both: point 
solutions to address specific network/systems issues, and a 
centralized, single pane of glass from a 'framework' system 
providing a common platform for event and problem management."

Another reader said organizational issues are an important 
factor. An approach must work within the organizational and 
political structure of a company:

"The approach with best of breed, plus some integration tools 
above it, is probably the less risky route - and for less 
integrated organizations, the better way to go. If you go for 
an integrated framework, you'd better be sure that you can 
handle it from an organizational viewpoint; otherwise it could 
be a hard, expensive landing." 

According to yet another reader, there are other factors that 
affect the decision on the management approach:

"Mostly this question is answered based on:

* How high up in the organization the decision is being made

* How pragmatically (quick and dirty vs. big and beautiful) 
  does one want to approach the issue

* How specific the requirements are

* Time of decision

"Each supplier has its rise and fall; the winner of today may 
be a loser tomorrow. If the different user [administrator] 
groups have a different timing regarding when they need a tool, 
they will probably come to different decisions."

Another user says:

"My personal favorite solution involves using vendor-supplied 
software agents such as IBM Director or Compaq Insight Manager 
and integrating them into a suite solution such as Tivoli or CA 
Unicenter. This removes not only the cost of the middleware and 
integration layers, but also removes the cost of the agent 
technology." 

So, there you have opinions from readers who embrace point 
products and suites working together.
