If you need to change things, please edit the spamassassin/trunk/build/buildbot
files in svn, then do a "sudo svn update" in /home/buildbot/bots/bbmass on the zones
box:

    ssh spamassassin.zones.apache.org
    cd /home/buildbot/bots/bbmass
    sudo svn update

once it's good to go, apply changes:
    
    sudo /etc/init.d/buildbot restart

Keep an eye on "tail -f twistd.log" for a few seconds to ensure it works,
and hit http://buildbot.spamassassin.org:8011/ .

note that you'll probably have to restart buildbot slaves on the slave
machines.   This is a PITA.
