About Apache SpamAssassin
-------------------------

Apache SpamAssassin is a mature, widely-deployed open source project
that serves as a mail filter to identify spam. SpamAssassin uses a variety
of mechanisms including mail header and text analysis, Bayesian filtering,
DNS blocklists, and collaborative filtering databases. In addition, Apache
SpamAssassin has a modular architecture that allows other technologies to be
quickly incorporated as an addition or as a replacement for existing methods.
Apache SpamAssassin typically runs on a server, classifies and labels spam
before it reaches your mailbox, while allowing other components of a mail
system to act on its results.

Most of the Apache SpamAssassin is written in Perl, with heavily traversed
code paths carefully optimized. Benefits are portability, robustness and
facilitated maintenance. It can run on a wide variety of POSIX platforms.
The server and the Perl library feels at home on Unix and Linux platforms,
and reportedly also works on MS Windows systems under ActivePerl.
