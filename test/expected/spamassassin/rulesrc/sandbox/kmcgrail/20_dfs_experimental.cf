#RULES FROM DFS FOR TESTING

#8/13/2013
#I'm seeing a fair bit of spam from the null return path.  That is,
#MAIL From:<> (or in the headers, Return-Path: <>).  A lot of this
#spam lacks any MIME headers (MIME-Version:, Content-Type:)
#
#I've experimented with a rule that adds points in this situation; most
#legitimate DSNs have a MIME-Version: header.
#
#So would anyone care to test this:
#
#meta DSN_NO_MIMEVERSION (__BOUNCE_RPATH_NULL && !__MIME_VERSION)
#describe DSN_NO_MIMEVERSION Return-Path <> and no MIME-Version: header
#score DSN_NO_MIMEVERSION 2
#
#The rules __BOUNCE_RPATH_NULL and __MIME_VERSION come from
#20_vbounce.cf and 20_head_tests.cf respectively and look like this:
#
#header __BOUNCE_RPATH_NULL    Return-Path =~ /<>/
#header __MIME_VERSION         exists:MIME-Version

meta DSN_NO_MIMEVERSION (__BOUNCE_RPATH_NULL && !__MIME_VERSION)
describe DSN_NO_MIMEVERSION Return-Path <> and no MIME-Version: header
score DSN_NO_MIMEVERSION 2

#EOF
