removed fixed scores in 50_scores.cf for rules in 00_FVGT_File001.cf
seems these were assigned before ruleqa autopromoted rules.

Testing what gets autopromoted and what should be deprecated.


# 2011-11-07 - AXB

Disabled / Commented out rules which had a hardcoded score of 0 in 50_scores.cf
Also removed those scores from 50_scores.cf
