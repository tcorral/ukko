# S25R is:  http://www.gabacho-net.jp/en/anti-spam/anti-spam-system.html
# S25R is seven regexps used to detect botnets by reverse DNS.
# Last updated with upstream regexps on 2009-11-23
# S25R is loosely licensed permissively with the following sentence:
# > I don't claim any exclusive rights about my idea. And, if you invent a
# > new means based on my idea, I hope you contribute it to the Internet
# > world without claiming exclusive rights.
# 
# The Upstream cleanses its list with a whitelist consisting of major sites like
# google.com, hotmail.com, data-hotel.net, yahoo.co.jp, yahoo.com, mixi.jp,
# home.ne.jp, softbank.ne.jp, ezweb.ne.jp, and verisign.net.  All of these
# correctly use SPF except yahoo (which uses DKIM), home.ne.jp, and verisign.
# The whitelist is way too big to be worthwhile, so we use SPF/DKIM/Greylisting.

# S25R_0 is equal to RDNS_NONE and has a host of problems.  We ignore it here.

# From the 2010 MIT Spam Conference "best student paper"
# "Detecting Gray in Black and White"
# by Christian Rossow, Thomas Czerwinski, Christian J. Dietrich (all students)
# http://bit.ly/Detecting_Gray_in_Black_and_White (PDF)
#
# The paper evaluates very similar methodology to the S25R concepts any my own
# tinkering within this space (of searching for dynamic-type names in rDNS).
# It cleanses itself with some white rDNS searches that might be interesting.
# Named RCD for the paper's authors but the rules and regex's are mine.
# Named MESSY because there are no delimiters (delimited versions unnecessary).
