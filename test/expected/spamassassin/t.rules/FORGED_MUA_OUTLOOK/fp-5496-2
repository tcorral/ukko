I have 2 remarks to start with.

I'm flabbergasted by the statement that "acts do not have physical location=
s". If I understand this right, then docters and nurses work "nowhere". What=
 about that as a justification for their salary ?!  :-)
I think you all agree that if Dr X gives patient Y an injection (in the nor=
mal non-science fiction way), then that act takes place in the room where th=
e docter and the patient are. If he does it by using a robot guided over the=
 internet while he being in Paris and the patient in the US, then the act ha=
ppened for sure on planet Earth. I do agree that determining where "the act"=
 happened in situations like the latter is not trivial, the problem not bein=
g that much the localisation, but rather what THE act IS. Although we would =
still use the word "injection" for the latter, it is obviously something com=
pletely different than the former, despite the fact that parts of the acts a=
re similar (e.g. the needle being brought into the patient's body).
This said, I have no problem with the fact that the statement that "an Act =
occurs at a specific physical location" be removed from the document however=
: it is not because you don't state "X" in a document, that "not X" should b=
e true.

Another point that I want to raise is the statement "An Act is documented b=
y an Act Record instance". It should be specified what "instance" refers to =
in this case, precisely in the light of what happens when that "instance" is=
 copied into other systems. Thus if act X is injecting patient U by physicia=
n V with product W in place P at time T, then Act Record instance AR1 might =
be the documentation of it by V (thus the Dr registered what he did) and Act=
 Record instance AR2 might be that the nurse who was in the room documented =
act X. Thus we have 2 instances documenting act X. If this information gets =
transfered and copied to other systems in persistent records, then I believe=
 "copies" of these Act Record instances are created, and not new instances. =
Otherwise, act X would be claimed to be documented by 2, 4, 6, 8 .... instan=
ces, which is actually not true.

I know, the RIM being based on a Kantian philosophy makes it hard to deal w=
ith (and for some even to see) this problem, but I think it is important. An=
d oh, you want for sure a "use case" for this: well suppose that there is so=
me legal argument about whether or not the injection was actually given. Are=
 ten copies of the same documentation instance more proof than just one ?   =
(note for Charlie: you can use this paragraph to build further on your file =
to document my "inability to productively collaborate with the community at =
large" and "Dr. Cuesters [sic] prefers to intermittently send sarcastic emai=
ls to various list servers".)

Note that may objection is not in the use of the word instance in that part=
icular sentence. In fact, I believe it is good practice, even that the state=
ment should read "An Act instance is documented by an Act Record instance", =
and even that the entire document should be checked whether "instance" shoul=
d not be used more often (I believe it does).
But even then, it should be specified what "instance" means in each case, e=
.g. a particular act in physical reality or an entry in a database which doc=
uments that act.

kind regards,

Werner

  Hi Gary,

  I like this work a lot.

  On quick review, I encountered this line which I think should be deleted.

  "An Act occurs at a specific physical location"

  In the past, our discussions in modeling specifically excluded this state=
ment. The use cases that were discussed included healthcare delivered over t=
he internet. If the patient is in one location, the physician in another loc=
ation, the nurse in a third location, and the EHR is in a fourth location, w=
here did the Act occur? For example, in telemedicine, the patient may be in =
one location and the physician is listening on a remote stethescope in anoth=
er location? Or observation is being performed via camera? Or the surgery is=
 being performed via a robot over the internet (as accomplished between US a=
nd Paris)?

  We came to the conclusion that participants have physical locations, but =
that acts do not have physical locations.

  In review of the rest of the document, I did not see that anything else n=
eeded to be changed because the "physical location of an act" comment was de=
leted.

  Also, in M&M, a dynamic model discussion is occurring. This document shou=
ld be sent to M&M for review before the dynamic model work is completed to m=
ake sure that M&M work and the EHR work are consistent.

  Thanks, Dan
