How exactly is having a private key password different from simply 
telling the user to kinit ONCE on their local machine before attempting 
to SSH to your Kerberized machines?

Also, you could rig up a login script (or PAM) that used a local keytab 
file to obtain AFS tickets automatically at sucessful login.  Not sure 
if you'd have to assume that someone logging as the local UNIX user 
automatically means that user would have to the matching AFS identity. 
You would also have issues of users keeping their passwords and the 
keytabs up to date or otherwise differentiating between the keytab login 
and their real Kerberos identity.

This might be question to ask on the AFS mailing lists instead of the 
Kerberos ones.
