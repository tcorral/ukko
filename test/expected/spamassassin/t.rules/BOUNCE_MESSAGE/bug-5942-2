This message was created automatically by mail delivery software.
A message that you sent has not yet been delivered to one or more of its
recipients after more than 48 hours on the queue on server.lx-host.net.

The message identifier is:     1KFsyl-0000YU-6I
The subject of the message is: =?koi8-r?B?4cLPzsXO1NPLz8Ugz8LTzNXWydfBzsnFIMvPzdDYwNTF0s/X?=
The date of the message is:    Mon, 7 Jul 2008 13:17:11 -0300

The address to which the message has not yet been delivered is:

  doska@alldo.ru
    Delay reason: mailbox is full

No action is required on your part. Delivery attempts will continue for
some time, and this warning may be repeated at intervals if the message
remains undelivered. Eventually the mail delivery software will give up,
and when that happens, the message will be returned to you.
