Startup spamd at boot time for OS X users.

To use:
Put this directory into /Library/StartupItems/

To customize:
The spamd startup script simply runs "spamd".  If you need to run a specific
spamd, or if spamd is not installed in your PATH, edit the "SPAMD" line
in the startup script to point at your spamd.
