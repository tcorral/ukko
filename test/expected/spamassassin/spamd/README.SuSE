ABOUT THE SUSE INIT SCRIPT
==========================

The init script called syse-ancient-rc-script.sh does only work on oldish
versions like 6.x and 7.x. It will die on all newer versions.

A more up-to-date script is available via the KMail Tools page [1,2]. It's
not included in this distro due to licensing "issues", ie. it is based on 
a GPL'd skeleton and had to be relicensed under an Apache license.
