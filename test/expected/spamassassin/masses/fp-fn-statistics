=head1 NAME

fp-fn-statistics - Display statistics about the quality of scores

=head1 SYNOPSIS

fp-fn-statistics [options]

  Options: 
    -c,--cffile=path	  Use path as the rules directory
    -s,--scoreset=n	  Use scoreset n
    -t,--threshold=n      Use a spam/ham threshold of n (default: 5)
    --lambda=n            Use a lambda value of n
    --spam=file           Location of mass-check spam log (spam.log)
    --ham=file            Location of mass-check ham log (ham.log)
    --fplog=file          File to which false positive logs should be saved
    --fnlog=file          File to which false negative logs should be saved

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<fp-fn-statistics> first calculates the score each message from a
masses.log would have under a new set of scores. It then aggregates
the number of messages correctly and incorrectly found as spam and
ham, and their average scores.

In addition, B<fp-fn-statistics> determines the "Total Cost Ratio" as
a result of the false positives and negatives mentioned above. This
calculation takes into the value of lambda, which represents the cost
of recovering a false positive, where 1 indicates a message is tagged
only, 9 means the message is mailed back to sender asking for a token
(TMDA style) and 999 means a message is delted. The default, 5,
represents the message being moved to an infrequently read folder.

B<fp-fn-statistics> can also save false positive and false negatives
logs to a file for future analysis. If this is all you're doing, it
could be accomplished a lot quicker with B<grep>, but why not reinvent
the wheel?
