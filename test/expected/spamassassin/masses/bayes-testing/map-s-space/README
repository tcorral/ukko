How to use this stuff: (Nov 26 2002 jm)
----------------------

- edit your copy of Bayes.pm so that $self->{log_raw_counts} = 1; .  This will
  cause the Bayes code to write the raw counts to stdout, so that the
  bayes-analyse-from-raw-counts script can dump a cost calculation and
  histogram very quickly, while still recalculating the probabilities with
  different values for the constants, and using different combining techniques.

- Next, run a 10-pass cross-validation run using bayes-10pcv-driver on your
  test corpus.

- Edit run-search and change the system()s around line 41 to refer to the
  spam_all.log and nonspam_all.log files from the run above.

- To test with chi-squared combining, edit the run-search script and change
  $USE_CHI_COMBINING to 1 instead of 0.

- Run

	./run-search | tee search.results

  This will pick random values for the constants in question, run
  bayes-analyse-from-raw-counts for that combination, and dump a line
  with the resulting cost figures.

- While this is running -- or at the end after 1k iterations, if you're very
  patient -- run gnuplot, and paste in the commands from gnuplot.cmds.  This
  will map the surface representing the cost figures for each combination of
  the constants.
