AUTOMC SETUP

- Set up the "corpus-hourly" stuff in masses/rule-qa as described there.

- Copy "config.example" to "config" and edit.

- you must do 1 commit as the "automc" userid interactively,
  so that the credentials are cached for that user.

- Use this crontab:

-----------------------------------
40 0,1,2 * * *  /PATH/spamassassin/masses/rule-qa/automc/RUNME.before
0 14,16,18,20,22 * * * /PATH/spamassassin/masses/rule-qa/automc/RUNME.after
-----------------------------------
