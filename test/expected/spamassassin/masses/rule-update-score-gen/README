Steps for generating scores for rules promoted post 3.2.0 release
(you only need to do the first three steps once):

 - checkout the directory this README file is in

 - create an RSYNC-CREDS file containing your nightly mass-check rsync creds
   (don't do something silly like 'svn add' this file):

    RSYNC_USERNAME="username"
    RSYNC_PASSWORD="passowrd"

 - protect those creds from others

    chmod 600 RSYNC-CREDS

 - if the newest mass-check logs are set0 logs run this:

    ./generate-new-scores 1
    ./generate-new-scores 0

 - if the newest mass-check logs are set1 logs run this:

    ./generate-new-scores 0
    ./generate-new-scores 1



Steps for using set0 scores for set2 and set1 scores for set3
(until we start enabling bayes on nightly mass-checks):

  - generate the set0 and set1 scores as above

  - run this:

    cp scores-set0 scores-set2
    cp scores-set1 scores-set3
    ./merge-scoresets



The "do-nightly-rescore-example" script is what I currently use to generate
and commit updates each day.
