How To Submit Nightly Mass-check Results
========================================


See http://wiki.spamassassin.org/w/NightlyMassCheck for instructions
on how to check out the correct version of SpamAssassin.

Next, cd to the "masses" subdir and create a new pair of mass-check logfiles
using that tag.

  cd /home/you/directory/spamassassin/masses
  rm ham.log spam.log
  touch ham.log spam.log

Run your mass-check script into those logfiles.  This is up to you!

Nightly mass-check runs are local-rules-only; weekly ones include network
tests.

Finally submit them to rsync.spamassassin.org.  Replace "you" with the username
you received (see CORPUS_SUBMIT for info), ditto for the password.

  RSYNC_PASSWORD="[whatever your password is]"
  export RSYNC_PASSWORD
  rsync -Pcvz ham.log you@rsync.spamassassin.org::corpus/ham-you.log
  rsync -Pcvz spam.log you@rsync.spamassassin.org::corpus/spam-you.log

That's it.
